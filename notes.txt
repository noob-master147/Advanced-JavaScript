Difference between let and var

let was recently introduced in 2015/ES5
var was present from the begining

let has block scope
var has function scope

var is hoisted at the top of its function
let is not hoisted

--------------------------------------------------

Difference between == & ===

they both are comparison operators

== only compares value 
=== compares both value and type

'1' == 1 returns true
'1' === 1 returns false 

--------------------------------------------------

Difference between let and const 

both are used to define variables

const are used to define constants 
once a value is defined it can not be changed

let helps to redefine the values and also lets to change type

suppose const is used to define not a primitive type like array
    we can push new values to the array but cant redefine it
    eg:
        const a = [1,2,3]
        a.push(4)       =>  allowed
        a[2] = 10       =>  not allowed
